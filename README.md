###quiz:
* Problem 5-1.py - Write a function called sampleQuizzes that implements a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the probability of a student having a final score >= 70 and <= 75.
* Problem 6-3.py - You observe that the probability of first seeing a 1 on the n-th roll decreases as n increases. You would like to know the smallest number of rolls such that this probability is less than some limit.
