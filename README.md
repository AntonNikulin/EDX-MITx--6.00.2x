EDX-MITx: 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

###quiz:
* Problem 5-1.py - Write a function called sampleQuizzes that implements a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the probability of a student having a final score >= 70 and <= 75.
* Problem 5-2.py - Write a procedure called plotQuizzes that produces a plot of the distribution of final scores for all of the trials. Try your best to match exactly how the histogram below looks (including the bins, titles and labels on the axes). Click the image to see a larger version.
* Problem 6-3.py - You observe that the probability of first seeing a 1 on the n-th roll decreases as n increases. You would like to know the smallest number of rolls such that this probability is less than some limit.
